        <h2>Description :</h2>
         <p><b>Biryani</b> is a rich and aromatic one-pot dish made from <b>rice, meat (chicken, beef, mutton, or fish)</b>, and a blend of aromatic spices.
             Its roots can be traced back to the Indian subcontinent, and it has spread to various parts of the world, especially with South Asian migration.
         </p> 
         <p>While its exact origins are debated,
             it is widely believed to have been brought to India by the Mughal emperors, who fused Persian cooking techniques with Indian ingredients.
